# Habitable Exoplanets: Assessing the Potential for Surface Water

The dataset used in this notebook is from the [NASA exoplanet archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu). Here, planets are considered ‘habitable’ if liquid water could exist on their surface. At temperatures greater than 100°C, water boils. At temperatures below 0°C, water freezes. This means for a planet to be deemed 'habitable', it must have a surface temperature between 0°C (273.15 K) and 100°C (373.15 K). The distance modulus equation is used to determine the distance of exoplanets from Earth. This value is then applied to calculate the luminosity, which in turn is used to estimate the temperature of the star. From these constants, the surface temperature can be approximated.
